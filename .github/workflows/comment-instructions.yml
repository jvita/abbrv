            ### ðŸ§¾ How to Submit Your System

            To submit your system to the repository, add a new comment with the command:

            \`\`\`
            /submit <url_of_your_gist>
            \`\`\`

            Where \`<url_of_your_gist>\` is a link to the Gist containing your system files.

            The Gist should contain the following files:

            - \`glyphs.json\`
            - \`modes.json\`
            - \`rules.json\`
            - \`phrases.json\`

            This will run a validation check on the system files and, if successful, open a PR to submit the system for review.

            You can re-submit the system by re-running the \`/submit <url_of_your_gist>\` command with the same or a new Gist link.
