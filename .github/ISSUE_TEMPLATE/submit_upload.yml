        ## Usage

        To submit your system to the repository, add a new comment with the command `/submit <url_of_your_gist>`...

        The Gist should contain the following files:

        - `glyphs.json`
        - `modes.json`
        - `rules.json`
        - `phrases.json`

        You can re-submit the system by re-running the same command.
